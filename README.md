## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Computer Science student with internship experience at Verizon, where I focused on software development and innovation. I'm deeply interested in building impactful technologyâ€”from AI-powered apps to data-driven web platforms. Outside of tech, I lead initiatives as an event planner with Girls Who Code and love exploring pop culture, film, and travel.
